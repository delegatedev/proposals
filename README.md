# Yam On Chain Proposals

**[Triggered Proposals](https://yam.finance/#/governance)**

## Development 

For the development we use the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolkit.

```sh
# Install rustup.
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

```sh
# Install the foundry binary.
cargo install --git https://github.com/gakonst/foundry --bin forge --locked
```

```sh
# Run forked network tests.
make test
```
